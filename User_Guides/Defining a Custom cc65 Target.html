<h2><a name="s1">1.</a> <a href="#toc1">Overview</a></h2>


<p>The cc65 toolset provides a set of pre-defined libraries that allow the
user to target the executable image to a variety of hardware platforms.
In addition, the user can create a customized environment so that the
executable can be targeted to a custom platform.  The following
instructions provide step-by-step instructions on how to customize the
toolset for a target that is not supported by the standard cc65
installation.</p>
<p>The platform used in this example is a Xilinx Field Programmable Gate
Array (FPGA) with an embedded 65C02 core.  The processor core supports
the additional opcodes/addressing modes of the 65SC02, along with the
STP and WAI instructions.  These instructions will create a set of files
to create a custom target, named SBC, for <b>S</b>ingle <b>B</b>oard
<b>C</b>omputer.</p>

<h2><a name="s2">2.</a> <a href="#toc2">System Memory Map Definition</a></h2>


<p>The targeted system uses block RAM contained on the XILINX FPGA for the
system memory (both RAM and ROM).  The block RAMs are available in
various aspect ratios, and they will be used in this system as 2K*8
devices.  There will be two RAMs used for data storage, starting at
location $0000 and growing upwards.  There will be one ROM (realized as
initialized RAM) used code storage, starting at location $FFFF and
growing downwards.</p>
<p>The cc65 toolset requires a memory configuration file to define the
memory that is available to the cc65 run-time environment, which is
defined as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote><code>
<hr>
<pre>MEMORY {
    ZP:        start =    $0, size =  $100, type   = rw, define = yes;
    RAM:       start =  $200, size = $0E00, define = yes;
    ROM:       start = $F800, size = $0800, file   = %O;
}
</pre>
<hr>
</code></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>ZP defines the available zero page locations, which in this case starts
at $0 and has a length of $100.  Keep in mind that certain systems may
require access to some zero page locations, so the starting address may
need to be adjusted accordingly to prevent cc65 from attempting to reuse
those locations.  Also, at a minimum, the cc65 run-time environment uses
26 zero page locations, so the smallest zero page size that can be
specified is $1A.  The usable RAM memory area begins after the 6502
stack storage in page 1, so it is defined as starting at location $200
and filling the remaining 4K of space (4096 - 2 *
256&nbsp;=&nbsp;3584&nbsp;=&nbsp;$0E00).  The 2K of ROM space begins at
address $F800 and goes to $FFFF (size&nbsp;=&nbsp;$0800).</p>
<p>Next, the memory segments within the memory devices need to be defined.
A standard segment definition is used, with one notable exception.  The
interrupt and reset vector locations need to be defined at locations
$FFFA through $FFFF.  A special segment named VECTORS is defined that
resides at these locations.  Later, the interrupt vector map will be
created and placed in the VECTORS segment, and the linker will put these
vectors at the proper memory locations.  The segment definition is:</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote><code>
<hr>
<pre>SEGMENTS {
    ZEROPAGE: load = ZP,  type = zp,  define   = yes;
    DATA:     load = ROM, type = rw,  define   = yes, run = RAM;
    BSS:      load = RAM, type = bss, define   = yes;
    HEAP:     load = RAM, type = bss, optional = yes;
    STARTUP:  load = ROM, type = ro;
    ONCE:     load = ROM, type = ro,  optional = yes;
    CODE:     load = ROM, type = ro;
    RODATA:   load = ROM, type = ro;
    VECTORS:  load = ROM, type = ro,  start    = $FFFA;
}
</pre>
<hr>
</code></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>The meaning of each of these segments is as follows.</p>

<p><code>       ZEROPAGE:  </code>Data in page 0, defined by ZP as starting at $0 with length $100</p>
<p><code>       DATA:      </code>Initialized data that can be modified by the program, stored in RAM</p>
<p><code>       BSS:       </code>Uninitialized data stored in RAM (used for variable storage)</p>
<p><code>       HEAP:      </code>Uninitialized C-level heap storage in RAM, optional</p>
<p><code>       STARTUP:   </code>The program initialization code, stored in ROM</p>
<p><code>       ONCE:      </code>The code run once to initialize the system, stored in ROM</p>
<p><code>       CODE:      </code>The program code, stored in ROM</p>
<p><code>       RODATA:    </code>Initialized data that cannot be modified by the program, stored in ROM</p>
<p><code>       VECTORS:   </code>The interrupt vector table, stored in ROM at location $FFFA</p>
<p>A note about initialized data:  any variables that require an initial
value, such as external (global) variables, require that the initial
values be stored in the ROM code image.  However, variables stored in
ROM cannot change; therefore the data must be moved into variables that
are located in RAM.  Specifying <code>run&nbsp;=&nbsp;RAM</code> as part of
the DATA segment definition will indicate that those variables will
require their initialization value to be copied via a call to the
<code>copydata</code> routine in the startup assembly code.  In addition,
there are system level variables that will need to be initialized as
well, especially if the heap segment is used via a C-level call to
<code>malloc&nbsp;()</code>.</p>
<p>The final section of the definition file contains the data constructors
and destructors used for system startup.  In addition, if the heap is
used, the maximum C-level stack size needs to be defined in order for
the system to be able to reliably allocate blocks of memory.  The stack
size selection must be greater than the maximum amount of storage
required to run the program, keeping in mind that the C-level subroutine
call stack and all local variables are stored in this stack.  The
<code>FEATURES</code> section defines the required constructor/destructor
attributes and the <code>SYMBOLS</code> section defines the stack size.  The
constructors will be run via a call to <code>initlib</code> in the startup
assembly code and the destructors will be run via an assembly language
call to <code>donelib</code> during program termination.</p>

<h2><a name="s3">3.</a> <a href="#toc3">Startup Code Definition</a></h2>


<p>In the cc65 toolset, a startup routine must be defined that is executed
when the CPU is reset.  This startup code is marked with the STARTUP
segment name, which was defined in the system configuration file as
being in read only memory.  The standard convention used in the
predefined libraries is that this code is resident in the crt0 module.
For this custom system, all that needs to be done is to perform a little
bit of 6502 housekeeping, set up the C-level stack pointer, initialize
the memory storage, and call the C-level routine <code>main&nbsp;()</code>.
The following code was used for the crt0 module, defined in the file
"crt0.s":</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote><code>

<p></p>
<p>The following discussion explains the purpose of several important
assembler level directives in this file.</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote><code>
<pre>.export   _init, _exit
</pre>
</code></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>This line instructs the assembler that the symbols <code>_init</code> and
<code>_exit</code> are to be accessible from other modules.  In this
example, <code>_init</code> is the location that the CPU should jump to when
reset, and <code>_exit</code> is the location that will be called when the
program is finished.</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote><code>
<pre>.import   _main
</pre>
</code></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>This line instructs the assembler to import the symbol <code>_main</code>
from another module.  cc65 names all C-level routines as
{underscore}{name} in assembler, thus the <code>main&nbsp;()</code> routine
in C is named <code>_main</code> in the assembler.  This is how the startup
code will link to the C-level code.</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote><code>
<pre>.export   __STARTUP__ : absolute = 1        ; Mark as startup
</pre>
</code></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>This line marks this code as startup code (code that is executed when
the processor is reset), which will then be automatically linked into
the executable code.</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote><code>
<pre>.import   __RAM_START__, __RAM_SIZE__       ; Linker generated
</pre>
</code></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>This line imports the RAM starting address and RAM size constants, which
are used to initialize the cc65 C-level argument stack pointer.</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote><code>
<pre>.segment  "STARTUP"
</pre>
</code></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>This line instructs the assembler that the code is to be placed in the
STARTUP segment of memory.</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote><code>
<pre>          JSR     zerobss              ; Clear BSS segment
          JSR     copydata             ; Initialize DATA segment
          JSR     initlib              ; Run constructors
</pre>
</code></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>These three lines initialize the external (global) and system
variables.  The first line sets the BSS segment -- the memory locations
used for external variables -- to 0.  The second line copies the
initialization value stored in ROM to the RAM locations used for
initialized external variables.  The last line runs the constructors
that are used to initialize the system run-time variables.</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote><code>
<pre>          JSR     _main
</pre>
</code></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>This is the actual call to the C-level <code>main&nbsp;()</code> routine,
which is called after the startup code completes.</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote><code>
<pre>_exit:    JSR     donelib              ; Run destructors
          BRK
</pre>
</code></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>This is the code that will be executed when <code>main ()</code>
terminates.  The first thing that must be done is run the destructors
via a call to <code>donelib</code>.  Then the program can terminate.  In
this example, the program is expected to run forever.  Therefore, there
needs to be a way of indicating when something has gone wrong and the
system needs to be shut down, requiring a restart only by a hard reset.
The BRK instruction will be used to indicate a software fault.  This is
advantageous because cc65 uses the BRK instruction as the fill byte in
the final binary code.  In addition, the hardware has been designed to
force the data lines to $00 for all illegal memory accesses, thereby
also forcing a BRK instruction into the CPU.</p>

<h2><a name="s4">4.</a> <a href="#toc4">Custom Run-Time Library Creation</a></h2>


<p>The next step in customizing the cc65 toolset is creating a run-time
library for the targeted hardware.  The easiest way to do this is to
modify a standard library from the cc65 distribution.  In this example,
there is no console I/O, mouse, joystick, etc. in the system, so it is
most appropriate to use the simplest library as the base, which is for
the Watara Supervision and is named "supervision.lib" in the
lib directory of the distribution.</p>
<p>The only modification required is to replace the <code>crt0</code> module in
the supervision.lib library with custom startup code.  This is simply
done by first copying the library and giving it a new name, compiling
the startup code with ca65, and finally using the ar65 archiver to
replace the module in the new library.  The steps are shown below:</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote><code>
<pre>$ copy "C:\Program Files\cc65\lib\supervision.lib" sbc.lib
$ ca65 crt0.s
$ ar65 a sbc.lib crt0.o
</pre>
</code></blockquote>
<p></p>

<h2><a name="s5">5.</a> <a href="#toc5">Interrupt Service Routine Definition</a></h2>


<p>For this system, the CPU is put into a wait condition prior to allowing
interrupt processing.  Therefore, the interrupt service routine is very
simple:  return from all valid interrupts.  However, as mentioned
before, the BRK instruction is used to indicate a software fault, which
will call the same interrupt service routine as the maskable interrupt
signal IRQ.  The interrupt service routine must be able to tell the
difference between the two, and act appropriately.</p>
<p>The interrupt service routine shown below includes code to detect when a
BRK instruction has occurred and stops the CPU from further processing.
The interrupt service routine is in a file named
"interrupt.s".</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote><code>

</p><blockquote><code>

<p></p>

the assembly code, the assembler is forced to use the 65C02 instruction
set with the <code>.PC02</code> directive.</p>
<p>The final step is to define the interrupt vector memory locations.
Recall that a segment named VECTORS was defined in the memory
configuration file, which started at location $FFFA.  The addresses of
the interrupt service routines from "interrupt.s" along with
the address for the initialization code in crt0 are defined in a file
named "vectors.s".  Note that these vectors will be placed in

<p><code>       $FFFC&nbsp;-&nbsp;$FFFD:</code> Reset vector (low byte, high byte)</p>
<p><code>       $FFFE&nbsp;-&nbsp;$FFFF:</code> IRQ/BRK interrupt vector (low byte, high byte)</p>

actual addresses of the routines during the link process.</p>

<h2><a name="s6">6.</a> <a href="#toc6">Adding Custom Instructions</a></h2>


<p>The cc65 instruction set only supports the WAI (Wait for Interrupt) and
STP (Stop) instructions when used with the 65816 CPU (accessed via the
--cpu command line option of the ca65 macro assembler) (tmr note: this is
out of date. The cc65 65C02 cpu supports these intructions).  The 65C02 core
used in this example supports these two instructions, and in fact the
system benefits from the use of both the WAI and STP instructions.</p>
<p>In order to use the WAI instruction in this case, a C routine named
"wait" was created that consists of the WAI opcode followed by
a subroutine return.  It was convenient in this example to put the IRQ
interrupt enable in this subroutine as well, since interrupts should
only be enabled when the code is in this wait condition.</p>
<p>For both the WAI and STP instructions, the assembler is
"fooled" into placing those opcodes into memory by inserting a
single byte of data that just happens to be the opcode for those
instructions.  The assembly code routines are placed in a file, named
"wait.s", which is shown below:</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote><code>
<hr>
<pre>; ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
; wait.s
; ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
;
; Wait for interrupt and return

.export  _wait, _stop

.endproc
</pre>
<hr>
</code></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>The label <code>_wait</code>, when exported, can be called by using the
<code>wait&nbsp;()</code> subroutine call in C.  The section is marked as
code so that it will be stored in read-only memory, and the procedure is
tagged for 16-bit absolute addressing via the "near"
modifier.  Similarly, the <code>_stop</code> routine can be called from
within the C-level code via a call to <code>stop&nbsp;()</code>.  In
addition, the routine can be called from assembly code by calling
<code>_stop</code> (as was done in the interrupt service routine).</p>

<h2><a name="s7">7.</a> <a href="#toc7">Hardware Drivers</a></h2>


<p>Oftentimes, it can be advantageous to create small application helpers
in assembly language to decrease codespace and increase execution speed
of the overall program.  An example of this would be the transfer of
characters to a FIFO (<b>F</b>irst-<b>I</b>n,
<b>F</b>irst-<b>O</b>ut) storage buffer for transmission over a
serial port.  This simple action could be performed by an assembly
language driver which would execute much quicker than coding it in C.
The following discussion outlines a method of interfacing a C program
with an assembly language subroutine.</p>
<p>The first step in creating the assembly language code for the driver is
to determine how to pass the C arguments to the assembly language
routine.  The cc65 toolset allows the user to specify whether the data
is passed to a subroutine via the stack or by the processor registers by
using the <code>__fastcall__</code> and <code>__cdecl__</code> function qualifiers (note that
there are two underscore characters in front of and two behind each
qualifier).  <code>__fastcall__</code> is the default.  When <code>__cdecl__</code> <em>isn't</em>
specified, and the function isn't variadic (i.e., its prototype doesn't have
an ellipsis), the rightmost argument in the function call is passed to the
subroutine using the 6502 registers instead of the stack.  Note that if
there is only one argument in the function call, the execution overhead
required by the stack interface routines is completely avoided.</p>
<p>With <code>__cdecl__</code>, the last argument is loaded into the A and X
registers and then pushed onto the stack via a call to <code>pushax</code>.
The first thing the subroutine does is retrieve the argument from the
stack via a call to <code>ldax0sp</code>, which copies the values into the A
and X.  When the subroutine is finished, the values on the stack must be
popped off and discarded via a jump to <code>incsp2</code>, which includes
the RTS subroutine return command.  This is shown in the following code
sample.</p>
<p>Calling sequence:</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote><code>
<pre>        lda     #&lt;(L0001)  ;  Load A with the high order byte
        ldx     #&gt;(L0001)  ;  Load X with the low order byte
        jsr     pushax     ;  Push A and X onto the stack
        jsr     _foo       ;  Call foo, i.e., foo (arg)
</pre>
</code></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>Subroutine code:</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote><code>
<pre>_foo:   jsr     ldax0sp    ;  Retrieve A and X from the stack
        sta     ptr        ;  Store A in ptr
        stx     ptr+1      ;  Store X in ptr+1
        ...                ;  (more subroutine code goes here)
        jmp     incsp2     ;  Pop A and X from the stack (includes return)
</pre>
</code></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>If <code>__cdecl__</code> isn't specified, then the argument is loaded into the A
and X registers as before, but the subroutine is then called
immediately.  The subroutine does not need to retrieve the argument
since the value is already available in the A and X registers.
Furthermore, the subroutine can be terminated with an RTS statement
since there is no stack cleanup which needs to be performed.  This is
shown in the following code sample.</p>
<p>Calling sequence:</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote><code>
<pre>        lda     #&lt;(L0001)  ;  Load A with the high order byte
        ldx     #&gt;(L0001)  ;  Load X with the low order byte
        jsr     _foo       ;  Call foo, i.e., foo (arg)

<p>The hardware driver in this example writes a string of character data to
a hardware FIFO located at memory location $1000.  Each character is
read and is compared to the C string termination value ($00), which will
terminate the loop.  All other character data is written to the FIFO.
For convenience, a carriage return/line feed sequence is automatically
appended to the serial stream.  The driver defines a local pointer
variable which is stored in the zero page memory space in order to allow
for retrieval of each character in the string via the indirect indexed
addressing mode.</p>

"rs232_tx.s" and is shown below:</p>

<h2><a name="s8">8.</a> <a href="#toc8">Hello World! Example</a></h2>


<p>The following short example demonstrates programming in C using the cc65
toolset with a custom run-time environment.  In this example, a Xilinx
FPGA contains a UART which is connected to a 65c02 processor with FIFO
(<b>F</b>irst-<b>I</b>n, <b>F</b>irst-<b>O</b>ut) storage to
buffer the data.  The C program will wait for an interrupt generated by
the receive UART and then respond by transmitting the string "Hello
World! " every time a question mark character is received via a
call to the hardware driver <code>rs232_tx&nbsp;()</code>.  The driver
prototype uses the <code>__fastcall__</code> extension to indicate that the
driver does not use the stack.  The FIFO data interface is at address
$1000 and is defined as the symbolic constant <code>FIFO_DATA</code>.
Writing to <code>FIFO_DATA</code> transfers a byte of data into the transmit
FIFO for subsequent transmission over the serial interface.  Reading
from <code>FIFO_DATA</code> transfers a byte of previously received data out
of the receive FIFO.  The FIFO status data is at address $1001 and is
defined as the symbolic constant <code>FIFO_STATUS</code>.  For convenience,
the symbolic constants <code>TX_FIFO_FULL</code> (which isolates bit 0 of
the register) and <code>RX_FIFO_EMPTY</code> (which isolates bit 1 of the
register) have been defined to read the FIFO status.</p>
<p>The following C code is saved in the file "main.c".  As this
example demonstrates, the run-time environment has been set up such that
all of the behind-the-scene work is transparent to the user.</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote><code>
<hr>
<pre>#define FIFO_DATA     (*(unsigned char *) 0x1000)
#define FIFO_STATUS   (*(unsigned char *) 0x1001)

#define TX_FIFO_FULL  (FIFO_STATUS &amp; 0x01)
#define RX_FIFO_EMPTY (FIFO_STATUS &amp; 0x02)

extern void wait ();
extern void __fastcall__ rs232_tx (char *str);

int main () {
  while (1) {                                     //  Run forever
    wait ();                                      //  Wait for an RX FIFO interrupt

    while (RX_FIFO_EMPTY == 0) {                  //  While the RX FIFO is not empty
      if (FIFO_DATA == '?') {                     //  Does the RX character = '?'
        rs232_tx ("Hello World!");                //  Transmit "Hello World!"
      }                                           //  Discard any other RX characters
    }
  }

  return (0);                                     //  We should never get here!

<p>The following commands will create a ROM image named "a.out"
that can be used as the initialization data for the Xilinx Block RAM
used for code storage:</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote><code>
<pre>$ cc65 -t none -O --cpu 65sc02 main.c
$ ca65 --cpu 65sc02 main.s
$ ca65 --cpu 65sc02 rs232_tx.s
$ ca65 --cpu 65sc02 interrupt.s
$ ca65 --cpu 65sc02 vectors.s
$ ca65 --cpu 65sc02 wait.s
$ ld65 -C sbc.cfg -m main.map interrupt.o vectors.o wait.o rs232_tx.o
          main.o sbc.lib
</pre>
</code></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>During the C-level code compilation phase (<code>cc65</code>), assumptions
about the target system are disabled via the <code>-t none</code> command
line option.  During the object module linker phase (<code>ld65</code>), the
target customization is enabled via inclusion of the <code>sbc.lib</code>
file and the selection of the configuration file via the <code>-C
sbc.cfg</code> command line option.</p>
<p>The 65C02 core used most closely matches the cc65 toolset processor
named 65SC02 (the 65C02 extensions without the bit manipulation
instructions), so all the commands specify the use of that processor via
the <code>--cpu 65sc02</code> option.</p>
