<em>cl65 is the compile &amp; link utility for cc65, the 6502 C compiler. It was
designed as a smart frontend for the C compiler (cc65), the assembler (ca65),
the object file converter (co65), and the linker (ld65).</em>

<h2><a name="s1">1.</a> <a href="#toc1">Overview</a></h2>


<p>cl65 is a frontend for cc65, ca65, co65 and ld65. While you may not use the
full power of the tools when calling them through cl65, most features are
available, and the use of cl65 is much simpler.</p>


<h2><a name="s2">2.</a> <a href="#toc2">Basic Usage</a></h2>


<p>The cl65 compile and link utility may be used to convert, compile, assemble
and link files. While the separate tools do just one step, cl65 knows how to
build object files from C files (by calling the compiler, then the assembler)
and other things.</p>

<p></p>
<p>Most of the options have the same meanings as the corresponding compiler,
assembler, and linker options. See the documentation for those tools for an
explanation. If an option is available for more than one of the tools, it
is set for all tools where it is available. One example for that is <code>-v</code>:
The compiler, the assembler, and the linker are all called with the <code>-v</code>
switch.</p>
<p>There are a few remaining options that control the behaviour of cl65:</p>
<p>
</p><dl>

<dt><b><code>-E</code></b></dt><dd>
<p>This option is passed to the cc65 compiler; and, it forces cl65 to stop
before the assembly step. That means that C-level preprocessor directives
are obeyed; and, macros are expanded.  But, the C source isn't compiled.
If the <code>-o</code> option isn't used, then the C code results are written into
files with a ".i" suffix on their base names.  Assembler files, object
files, and libraries given on the command line are ignored.</p>


</dd><dt><b><code>-S</code></b></dt><dd>
<p>This option forces cl65 to stop before the assembly step. That means that
C files are translated into assembler files; but, nothing more is done.
Assembler files, object files, and libraries given on the command line
are ignored.</p>


</dd><dt><b><code>-c</code></b></dt><dd>
<p>This option forces cl65 to stop after the assembly step. That means
that C and assembler files given on the command line are translated into
object files; but, there is no link step.  Object files and libraries
given on the command line are ignored.</p>


</dd><dt><b><code>-o name</code></b></dt><dd>
<p>The -o option is used for the target name in the final step. That causes
problems if the linker will not be called, and there are several input
files on the command line. In that case, the name given with -o will be
used for all of them, which makes the option pretty useless. You
shouldn't use <code>-o</code> when more than one output file is created.</p>


</dd><dt><b><code>--print-target-path</code></b></dt><dd>
<p>This option prints the absolute path of the target file directory, and exits
then. It is supposed to be used with shell backquotes or the GNU make shell
function. That way, you can write build scripts or Makefiles accessing target
files without any assumption about the cc65 installation path.</p>


</dd><dt><b><code>-t sys, --target sys</code></b></dt><dd>
<p>The default for this option is "none" which is different from the original
compiler and linker which uses "c64". This makes this tool the same as the 
other tools (compiler, assembler, and linker) which use the "none" system settings
by default. The original cl65 uses "c64" as a target system by default. That was
chosen because most people seem to use cc65 to develop for the C64.</p>


</dd><dt><b><code>--no-target-lib</code></b></dt><dd>
<p>This option tells the cl65 to not include the target library into the list
of libraries.</p>



</dd><dt><b><code>-Wa options, --asm-args options</code></b></dt><dd>
<p>Pass options directly to the assembler. This may be used to pass options
that aren't directly supported by cl65. Several options may be separated by
commas; the commas are replaced by spaces when passing them to the
assembler. Beware: Passing arguments directly to the assembler might interfere
with some of the defaults because cl65 doesn't parse the options passed. So,
if cl65 supports an option by itself, do not pass that option to the
assembler by means of the <code>-Wa</code> switch.</p>


</dd><dt><b><code>-Wc options, --cc-args options</code></b></dt><dd>
<p>Pass options directly to the compiler. This may be used to pass options
that aren't directly supported by cl65. Several options may be separated by
commas; the commas are replaced by spaces when passing them to the
compiler. Beware: Passing arguments directly to the compiler might interfere
with some of the defaults because cl65 doesn't parse the options passed. So,
if cl65 supports an option by itself, do not pass that option to the
compiler by means of the <code>-Wc</code> switch.</p>


</dd><dt><b><code>-Wl options, --ld-args options</code></b></dt><dd>
<p>Pass options directly to the linker. This may be used to pass options that
aren't directly supported by cl65. Several options may be separated by
commas; the commas are replaced by spaces when passing them to the linker.
Beware: Passing arguments directly to the linker might interfere with some of
the defaults because cl65 doesn't parse the options passed. So, if cl65
supports an option by itself, do not pass that option to the linker by means
of the <code>-Wl</code> switch.</p>

<h2><a name="s3">3.</a> <a href="#toc3">More usage</a></h2>


<p>Because cl65 was created to simplify the use of the cc65 development
package, it tries to be smart about several things.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>  If you don't give a target system on the command line, cl65
defaults to the C64.
</li>
<li>  When linking, cl65 will supply the name of the library file for
the target system to the linker; so, you don't have to do that.
</li>
<li>  If the final step is the linker, and the name of the output file was
not explicitly given, cl65 will use the name of the first input file
without the extension, provided that the name of that file has an
extension. So, you don't need to give the executable name in most
cases; just give the name of your "main" file as the first input file.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>The command line is parsed from left to right, and the actual processing tool
(compiler, assembler, ...) is invoked whenever a file name is encountered.
This means that only the options to the left of a file name are in effect when
this file is processed. It does also mean that you're able to specify
different options for different files on the command line. As an example.</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote><code>
<pre>        cl65 -Oirs main.c -O -g module.c
</pre>
</code></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>translates main.c with full optimization and module.c with less optimization
and debug info enabled.</p>
<p>The type of an input file is derived from its extension:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>C files: <code>.c</code></li>
<li>Assembler files: <code>.s</code>, <code>.asm</code>, <code>.a65</code></li>
<li>Object files: <code>.o</code>, <code>.obj</code></li>
<li>Libraries: <code>.a</code>, <code>.lib</code></li>
<li>GEOS resource files: <code>.grc</code></li>
<li>o65 files: <code>.o65</code>, <code>.emd</code>, <code>.joy</code>, <code>.tgi</code></li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>Please note that the program cannot handle input files with unknown file
extensions.</p>


<h2><a name="s4">4.</a> <a href="#toc4">Examples</a></h2>


<p>The morse trainer software, which consists of one C file (morse.c) and one
assembler file (irq.s) will need the following separate steps to compile
into an executable named morse:</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote><code>
<pre>        cc65 -g -Oi -t c64 morse.c
        ca65 -g morse.s
        ca65 -g irq.s
        ld65 -o morse -t c64 c64.o morse.o irq.o c64.lib
</pre>
</code></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>When using cl65, this is simplified to</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote><code>
<pre>        cl65 -g -Oi morse.c irq.s
</pre>
</code></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>As a general rule, you may use cl65 instead of cc65 at most times,
especially in makefiles to build object files directly from C files. Use</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote><code>
<pre>        .c.o:
                cl65 -g -Oi $&lt;
</pre>
</code></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>to do this.</p>
